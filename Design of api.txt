Design of api and encrypted data
Only a few variables are allowed to be passed by the sensor:
Location
Type of sensor
Test type
Sensor owner for assignment of blame and commendation (social ecosystem comes with this?)
Value sensor produces
Reported trigger value
Reported threshold value
Reported normal value
These can be encrypted into a format, each with its own separate parse separator in a standard ascii string able to be received by a POST.
