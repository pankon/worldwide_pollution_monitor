Client passing information to the server
This very front end to a scaling backend is a very difficult aspect to construct. It is the weakest place information-wise and allows for construction of false reports if the system is too readable.
The client can also not be too heavy. 
Probably the easiest way to do this initially is a rolling set of key with client ip pathping stored. The pathping becomes a flag, which could be investigated in a social framework.
