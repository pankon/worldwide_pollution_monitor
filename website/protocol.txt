Protocol
This is designed to be a sub-website that simply handles
data and caches it, then passes it forward at when traffic
appears to be low.
The idea is that any interested party can simply download
these files to their existing web server in a subfolder named
according to a uuid.
The more access points, the better - since this is designed
to handle worldwide traffic, the more webservers that
contribute the better.

The configuration file should set up:
- The transfer time of day

Stored in memory is a mini-db of encrypted user information
and the data sent. This file is kept as small as possible
(the sensor has a constant list daily updated of all
friendly webservers, and contacts the one with the lowest
ping time).

Cache protocol is:
