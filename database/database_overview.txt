The databases are from initial conception meant to be established in an ad-hoc way, maintained by enthusiasts and sympathizers. 
Rules:
Each database except for the masters are fully replacable.
Each database must allow for easy, basically no-configure setup. 
Each layer of database communicates through a url or universal api.
Data is tightly controlled and encrypted at lower levels.
